    "* The slides include the ability to interactively evaluate Python expressions, which we'll use a *lot *in class. \n",
    "* The slides will be available in Github so you can go back to them later, get your own copies, etc. \n",
    "* I'll add links for further reading, with challenge levels:\n",
